# Mastering FreeRTOS: Hands-On FreeRTOS and STM32Fx with Debugging

This repository documents my progress and projects as I work through the **"Mastering FreeRTOS: Hands-On FreeRTOS and STM32Fx with Debugging"** course by FastBit Embedded Brain Academy. The course focuses on practical, hands-on learning of FreeRTOS (a real-time operating system) and its integration with STM32Fx microcontrollers, along with debugging techniques.

## About the Course
The course covers:
- Fundamentals of FreeRTOS and real-time operating systems.
- Task creation, scheduling, and synchronization.
- Inter-task communication using queues, semaphores, and mutexes.
- Memory management and debugging techniques.

## Repository Contents
This repository includes:
- Code examples and projects developed during the course.
- Notes and summaries of key concepts.
- Debugging tips and best practices.
- Additional resources and references for further learning.

## Goals
- Gain a deep understanding of FreeRTOS and its application in embedded systems.
- Develop proficiency in debugging embedded systems.
- Build a portfolio of projects demonstrating my skills in FreeRTOS and STM32Fx.

## Progress Tracking
I will regularly update this repository with my progress, including:
- Completed modules and exercises.
- Challenges faced and solutions implemented.
- Future goals and areas for improvement.

## How to Use This Repository
- Clone the repository to explore the code and projects.
